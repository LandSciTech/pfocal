Description: Provides functions to create and apply discretized convolution kernels to 
    rectangular data (matrix, raster). The calculations are implemented
    in parallel to reduce processing time. Moving window calculations are common in many fields, from image processing
    to raster data manipulation. This package provides a fast alternative to
    existing single thread implementations of focal moving window methods.
